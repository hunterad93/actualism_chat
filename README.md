# actualism_chat
a fun chatbot that uses 'actualfreedom.com.au' as its knowledge base for retrieval augmented chat

Specifically it uses the downloadable 'actual freedom lite' from this page: http://www.actualfreedom.com.au/sundry/aflite.htm

The `knowledge_base_generator.ipynb` extracts all .htm files from this download, and converts them to html for compatabiity with the OpenAI vector store.
