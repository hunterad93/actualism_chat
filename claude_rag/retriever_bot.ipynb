      "3. **Explore Remote Work Opportunities**: If your goal is to achieve financial independence through online work, start exploring remote job opportunities or freelancing platforms. Update your resume and create profiles on websites like Upwork, Freelancer, or Fiverr to start building your online presence.\n",

       "  'raw_string': '. One starts by dismantling the sense of social identity  that has been overlaid, from birth onward, over the innate self until one is virtually free from all the social mores and psittacisms ... those  mechanical repetitions of previously received ideas or images, reflecting neither apperception nor autonomous reasoning. One can be virtually free  from all the beliefs, ideas, values, theories, truths, customs, traditions, ideals, superstitions ... and all the other schemes and dreams. One can  become aware of all the socialisation, of all the conditioning, of all the programming, of all the methods and techniques that were used to produce  what one thinks and feels oneself to be ... a wayward social identity careering around in confusion and illusion. A \\x91mature adult\\x92 is actually  a lost, lonely, frightened and very cunning entity. However, it is never too late to start in on uncovering and discovering what one actually is.   3. \\x91One can become virtually free from all the insidious feelings \\x96 the emotions and passions \\x96 that fuel the mind and  give credence to all the illusions and delusions and fantasies and hallucinations that masquerade as visions of The Truth. One can become virtually  free of all that which has encumbered humans with misery and despair and live in a state of virtual freedom ... which is beyond \\x91normal\\x92 human  expectations anyway. Then, and only then, can the day of destiny dawn wherein one becomes actually free. One will have obtained release from one\\x92s  fate and achieved one\\x92s birthright ... and the world will be all the better for it. It is now possible.   4. \\x91Finally, a genuine opportunity for peace-on-earth to happen has become possible. Persons anywhere can start the process  by deciding to lock-on to pure intent and begin to discover just exactly what one actually is. Pure intent is born out of the peak experience  wherein it is seen, with startling clarity and precision, what I actually am. If one can have a pure consciousness experience momentarily, one can  have another ... and another ... and so on. Eventually, with application and diligence, one can have, more or less, continuous peak experience ...  one\\x92s life has been transformed into a virtual freedom. Altogether, it is vastly better than attending yet another retreat in order to become \\x91open  and vulnerable\\x92 and \\x91loving and compassionate\\x92. This discovery works ... it delivers!   5. \\x91Even if one does not immediately self-immolate psychologically and psychically there is a truly remarkable virtual  freedom that can be attained through application and diligence borne upon pure intent. For those that would seek to excuse themselves on the  grounds that I am freak, an aberration of nature, this factor belies this justification. It is possible to be virtually free, virtually perfect,  virtually pure. To be sure, to live the ultimate requires more than the abrogation of the right to be the social identity, but something quite  remarkable is possible before the event. One can, because of pure intent, voluntarily forsake the social identity, and go into exile, into  self-retirement, whilst remaining in the market place. One does this by examining all of one\\x92s beliefs \\x96 masquerading as \\x91truths\\x92 \\x96 and  watching them vanish as if they had never existed. One can observe oneself in one\\x92s moment-to-moment activities as one goes about daily life.  Gradually one notices that \\x91I\\x92 have grown rather thin, as if withering away, until \\x91I\\x92 become merely a shadow of \\x91my\\x92 former self ...  causing very little trouble and then only occasionally. This condition will continue to subsist until the inevitable happens and \\x91I\\x92 cease to  exist in \\x91my\\x92 totality of \\x91being\\x92',\n",

       "  'raw_string': ' from a Master, a Guru, a Spiritual Teacher or a Whatever. Some disciplines hint at its existence but no one has ever lived it to speak about  it knowledgeably, hence the deafening silence. Some religions posit such a condition pertaining to the other side of physical death \\x96  Mahasamadhi and Parinirvana being two examples that spring to mind \\x96 but no useful information can be derived from there. I maintain that  such a condition is possible while the body is still alive and breathing ... but for this to occur not only must the ego \\x91die\\x92 but the  soul must be extirpated as well. Only then are all illusions and delusions dispelled. Only then can there be an actual freedom. Understanding  all this promotes an actualism which ensures a virtual freedom. In actualism all of the previous world-views \\x96 human\\x92s understandings of  \\x91humanity\\x92 \\x96 are seen to be erroneous. Especially erroneous are the Divine solutions to the plight of \\x91humanity\\x92 ... however long  such solutions may have been held in awe, venerated and viewed as being Sacred.   2. \\x91The way of becoming actually free is both simple and practical. One starts by dismantling the  sense of social identity that has been overlaid, from birth onward, over the innate self until one is virtually free from all the social mores  and psittacisms ... those mechanical repetitions of previously received ideas or images, reflecting neither apperception nor autonomous  reasoning. One can be virtually free from all the beliefs, ideas, values, theories, truths, customs, traditions, ideals, superstitions ... and  all the other schemes and dreams. One can become aware of all the socialisation, of all the conditioning, of all the programming, of all the  methods and techniques that were used to produce what one thinks and feels oneself to be ... a wayward social identity careering around in  confusion and illusion. A \\x91mature adult\\x92 is actually a lost, lonely, frightened and very cunning entity. However, it is never too late to  start in on uncovering and discovering what one actually is.   3. \\x91One can become virtually free from all the insidious feelings \\x96 the emotions and passions  \\x96 that fuel the mind and give credence to all the illusions and delusions and fantasies and hallucinations that masquerade as visions of The  Truth. One can become virtually free of all that which has encumbered humans with misery and despair and live in a state of virtual freedom  ... which is beyond \\x91normal\\x92 human expectations anyway. Then, and only then, can the day of destiny dawn wherein one becomes actually  free. One will have obtained release from one\\x92s fate and achieved one\\x92s birthright ... and the world will be all the better for it. It is  now possible.   4. \\x91Finally, a genuine opportunity for peace-on-earth to happen has become possible. Persons  anywhere can start the process by deciding to lock-on to pure intent and begin to discover just exactly what one actually is. Pure intent is  born out of the peak experience wherein it is seen, with startling clarity and precision, what I actually am. If one can have a pure  consciousness experience momentarily, one can have another ... and another ... and so on. Eventually, with application and diligence, one can  have, more or less, continuous peak experience ... one\\x92s life has been transformed into a virtual freedom. Altogether, it is vastly better  than attending yet another retreat in order to become \\x91open and vulnerable\\x92 and \\x91loving and compassionate\\x92. This discovery works ...  it delivers!   5. \\x91Even if one does not immediately self-immolate psychologically and psychically there is a  truly remarkable virtual freedom that can be attained through application and diligence',\n",
